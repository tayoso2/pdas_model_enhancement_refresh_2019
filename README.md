# PDaS and S24 Spatial Mapping Project

## Project Description

The PDaS and S24 Spatial Mapping project was designed to utilise advanced spatial analytics in  improving STWâ€™s understanding of the location of S24 shared drains and PDaS assets and their key  attributes, i.e., length, material, diameter and yearlaid. Arcadis Gen was tasked with generating a set of  inferred PDaS and S24 assets and their neighbouring proxy sewer mains.
